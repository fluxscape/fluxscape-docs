# Supabase

> This is currently a private extension to Fluxscape. The documentation is still under development and will be improved over time.

Fluxscape’s Supabase integration provides a first-class way to sync data, authenticate users, and trigger serverless workflows directly from within Fluxscape apps.

The integration is designed for teams building production-grade applications that require a robust backend, strong data modeling, row-level security, and scalable serverless functions, all while staying inside the Fluxscape visual workflow.

### Access to the Supabase integration

The Supabase integration is currently available by request.

If you are interested in using it or evaluating it for your team or customers, please contact the Fluxscape team via  
https://fluxscape.io/contact

We use this process to ensure proper onboarding, feedback.
